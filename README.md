# pic10c_project
For final project

After walting many Qt game tutorials and former c++ projects on Youtube, I decided to create a game, where players need to collect treasures without being caught by soldiers.



Game Design
//I should write a description about the game here, about what the codes do


Knowledge relevent
RAII/memory //not yet adjusted
lambda // see if we would use it somewhere
template// well???
functors//good idea for Qt???
polymorohism //probably I can do it for soldier
smart_ptrs //not doing it for Qt classes, or can I?



Progress
at first watching qt game design tutorials to see what to be done
then implement my own

need to learn how Qt manages its memory
